# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
Using data analysis to help the production team identify ideal vehicle performance factors on AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Using RStudio's multiple linear regression, the following data was collected:

According to our results, we can conclude:
  - A:  Vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. The p-scores show that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 2.60 x 10<sup>-12</sup> & 5.21 x 10<sup>-8</sup> respectively, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. 
  - B:  The slope of our linear model is not zero.  This is shown in the estimate column for each varible.  
  - C:  The r-squared value, shows that 71.4% of the variation in mpg can be explained by the prototype specifications reveiwed.  Meaning this is a fairly effective model to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
